# Peergrading_simulation
 The simulated system consists of a group of people grading each other homeworks. Specifically, taken a students population, every homework will be evaluated by a sample of the population. The extension simulates a slightly different scenarios in which collusion might occur.
 In the reports we perform analyses on different input parameters impacts, studying the behavior of the system.
 
 The codes can be run as presented, providing images shown in the reports.
 To run the actual simulations uncomment the simulation part, and delete the csv.
 
 N.B. csv files are written in append mode to recover from the last parameters set in case of failure occurrance , since simulations take several minutes
 
 The results are summarized in https://github.com/ScorcaF/Peergrading_simulation/blob/67750d368de5bd5dc6e7047b508ee75ca1b469ff/PeerGrader%20simulator%20-%20implementation.pdf
